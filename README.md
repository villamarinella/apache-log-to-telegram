# apache-log-to-telegram
watch apache log with telegram

I have an apache webserver running and want to know if somebody has a look on my sites.

So I made a simple python2 script which send me always the last access data into my telegram account.

You will find:

apache.py
th.sh
README.md

You have to change on the top of the files your personal data.
It is quite simple and easy to understand.

Just start it with python apache.py

Stay lucky
